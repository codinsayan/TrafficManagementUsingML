# Implementing Smart Traffic Management through existing CCTV Network

## Why this?
**Traffic Congestion and Delays:** Static traffic signal timings fail to accommodate fluctuating traffic volumes, leading to unnecessary waiting times and bottlenecks

**Environmental Impact**: Idling vehicles contribute to higher emissions, degraded air quality, and unnecessary fuel consumption.

**Emergency Response:** Congested roads can delay emergency responders. An intelligent system can prioritize & clear routes for such vehicles, improving response times

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed system uses CCTV cameras to capture real-time traffic images and analyze traffic density using YOLO-based object detection. By identifying vehicles such as cars, bikes, buses, and trucks, it dynamically adjusts signal timings to optimize traffic flow.

The Vehicle Detection Module utilizes a custom-trained YOLO model for fast and accurate vehicle recognition. It processes images in real-time using the OpenCV to draw bounding boxes around detected vehicles, ensuring precise classification.

The Signal Switching Module adjusts green signal durations based on real-time traffic density. Factors like lane count, vehicle type, start-up lag, and average vehicle speed determine signal timing. The system captures images five seconds before switching signals to allow timely processing. A cyclic signal pattern (red → green → yellow → red) ensures smooth transitions and prevents lane starvation.

The Simulation Module developed in AnyLogic visualizes a four-way intersection with traffic signals, timers, and vehicle movement. It simulates real-world traffic flow, allowing comparison between adaptive signal control and traditional static signals, demonstrating the system’s efficiency in reducing congestion.

## INNOVATION
